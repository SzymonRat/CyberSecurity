Benefits of the proactive threat hunting

Proactive threat hunting is built around an “assume breach” mindset rather than a
traditional approach of waiting for endpointvdetection tools to identify potential threats.
While the latter approach works for automated and well-known attacks, today’s humanoperated attacks are more complex. Proactive
threat hunting helps to uncover hidden security threats that hide in your environment and
discover vulnerabilities

XDR and Zero Trust

Extended detection and response, often abbreviated as XDR, is a fully integrated set of security
tools that offers holistic, optimized security by integrating security products and data into
simplified solutions. XDR combines prevention, detection, investigation, and response, providing
visibility, analytics, correlated incident alerts, and automated responses to improve data
security and combat threats.
A modern organization’s cybersecurity assets span a variety of first-party and third-party networks,
applications, cloud databases, mobile devices, and identities. The digital perimeter as it exists now
is a dynamic and ever-evolving landscape

Besides XDR, one of the best ways to move beyond endpoints is to follow the principles of Zero
Trust. The main tenets of a Zero Trust philosophy are to authenticate and authorize access every
time, limit user access to just what they need for what they’re working on and assume breach by
implementing end-to-end encryption verification and analytics in threat detection efforts.
A Zero Trust approach should extend throughout the entire digital estate and serve as an
integrated security philosophy and end-to-end strategy. This is done by implementing Zero Trust
controls and technologies across six foundational elements – Identity, Endpoints, Data, Apps,
Infrastructure, and Network. Each of these is a source of signal, a control plane for enforcement,
and a critical resource to be defended.

Cloud Identity Compromise

Most cloud data theft attacks are the result of a cloud identity compromise, improperly secured information, or an
overexposed credential. Cloud data theft attacks can be difficult to detect as they commonly involve detecting
anomalous activity being performed using authenticated identities

Threat hunting actions/Indicators of compromised:
 
  - look for suspicious cloud application data usage spikes
  - suspicious provisioning of permissions to allow remote access
  - providing unusual permissions for one identity over another
  - Unusual changes in MFA
  -anomalous volumes of cloud identity activity for previously quiet identities
  - suspicious authentication patterns

Investigation actions:
 
   - determine if data is properly secured
   - ensure that no annoymous acess to data is allowed
   - revies access control lists
   - determine if any cloud app got new permissions to the data
   -determine if data was stolen using compromised credentials
   - in Azure Active Directory, search audit logs for any illegitimate accounts, role chanes, approvals
   - look for configuration changes
   - look for other activites performed by the same IP address
   - check if ISP or geolocation of the IP is not normal
   - review any apps that may have been granted ttenant-wide permission by the identity
   - use Azure Active Directory Activity Logs in Axure Monitor and the IdentityLogonEvents
   -Consider creating custom detecting rules
