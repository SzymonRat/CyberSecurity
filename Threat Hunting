Benefits of the proactive threat hunting

Proactive threat hunting is built around an “assume breach” mindset rather than a
traditional approach of waiting for endpointvdetection tools to identify potential threats.
While the latter approach works for automated and well-known attacks, today’s humanoperated attacks are more complex. Proactive
threat hunting helps to uncover hidden security threats that hide in your environment and
discover vulnerabilities

XDR and Zero Trust

Extended detection and response, often abbreviated as XDR, is a fully integrated set of security
tools that offers holistic, optimized security by integrating security products and data into
simplified solutions. XDR combines prevention, detection, investigation, and response, providing
visibility, analytics, correlated incident alerts, and automated responses to improve data
security and combat threats.
A modern organization’s cybersecurity assets span a variety of first-party and third-party networks,
applications, cloud databases, mobile devices, and identities. The digital perimeter as it exists now
is a dynamic and ever-evolving landscape

Besides XDR, one of the best ways to move beyond endpoints is to follow the principles of Zero
Trust. The main tenets of a Zero Trust philosophy are to authenticate and authorize access every
time, limit user access to just what they need for what they’re working on and assume breach by
implementing end-to-end encryption verification and analytics in threat detection efforts.
A Zero Trust approach should extend throughout the entire digital estate and serve as an
integrated security philosophy and end-to-end strategy. This is done by implementing Zero Trust
controls and technologies across six foundational elements – Identity, Endpoints, Data, Apps,
Infrastructure, and Network. Each of these is a source of signal, a control plane for enforcement,
and a critical resource to be defended.
