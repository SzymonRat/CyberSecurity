Customers (acquiring organizations) may use this guidance for assessing, and
measuring security practices relative to the software lifecycle as well as for
acquisition, deployment, and operational phases of a software supply chain.

Vendor (software supplier) is responsible for liaising between the customer and software
developer. Accordingly, vendor responsibilities include ensuring the integrity and security of
software via contractual agreements, software releases and updates, notifications, and mitigations
of vulnerabilities.

=======================================Definitions===========================================================

A upplier acts as a liaison pr intermediary between the developer and a customer and as such retains
primary responsibilities for the following:

1. Maintaininf the integrity of the securely delivered sofftware

2. Validating software packages and updates

3. Mintaining awerness of known vulnerabilities

4. Accept cutomer reports of issues or newly discovered vulnerabilities  and notifing 
developers for remediations

Policies should be established and implemented that specify checks required to securly 
deliver software. These policies should be accessible and knnownby everyone who has a role in 
software development life cycle (SDLC) and should include:
   - notifing customers of vulnerabilities
   - mechanisms used for the mitigations
   - End-of-life support (EOL)
   
   
   The following mitigations can help reduce threats and risks associated with the deployment process:
   
    1. Verify if the software shipped is the same as the recived
    
    2. Create fully signed images and binary code
    
    3. Ensure the secure hash to validate the binary
    
    4. Establish that communication channel is secure
    
    5. Establish a secure process fro updates ad pataches
