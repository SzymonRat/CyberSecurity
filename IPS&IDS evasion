When scanning our target with nmap to discover what services/ports are avilable for exploitation
it can happen that we will be flagged by IPS/IDS, so in order to bypass them we can user the following techniques:

1. Send grabage data

nmap -A <victim_ip> --data-length 25

2. Send a packet with the value of TTL just enough to arrive to the IPS/IDS
but not enough to arrive to the host system, and then send another packet
with the regular value of TTL

namp -A <victim_ip> --ttlvalue <value>

3. Fragment our packet

nmap -A victim_io> -f
